ComputerMusic
=============

Interactive machine learning applied to computer music.

The general idea is to demonstrate that users without prior knowledge of music theory can learn the basics
by teaching a computer to learn! This works with music because music is one of the few fields where a user can
determine that music sounds good without knowing the technical details as to why it sounds good.

THIS IS STILL BEING BUILT! I will be committing about once a week on average. A usable prototype should be ready
by January, 2014.
