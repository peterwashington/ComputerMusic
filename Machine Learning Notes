===Reinforcement Machine Learning===
- Discrete-time Markov Decision Process
- If the probabilities or rewards are unknown, the problem is one of reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998)
- Software agent (MIDI player) takes actions (playing a note) in environment (Markov decision process) to maximize reward 
  from a state transition (the reward being defined by the user input)
